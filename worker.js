// Copilot: Create a Cloudflare Worker script that serves static files from a folder called /public.
// The Worker should:
// 1. Show a simple HTML form asking for the user's name if no name is provided in the URL query.
// 2. If a name is provided, serve the requested static file from /public, defaulting to index.html.
// 3. Handle any path under /public.
